> 1. `let taskList = [];` - An empty array called `taskList` is created to store the tasks.

> 2. `document.querySelector('#form').addEventListener('submit', (e) => {` - The code selects the form element with the id "form" and adds a submit event listener to it. When the form is submitted, the provided callback function is executed.

> 3. `e.preventDefault();` - The first action inside the callback function is to prevent the default form submission behavior, which avoids the page from being refreshed.

> 4. `let taskInput = document.querySelector('#taskInput');` - The code selects the input field with the id "taskInput" and assigns it to the `taskInput` variable.

> 5. `let task = taskInput.value;` - The value entered in the task input field is extracted and stored in the `task` variable.

> 6. `let newTask = { name: task, completed: false };` - A new task object is created using the `task` value and a default value of `false` for the `completed` property.

> 7. `taskList.push(newTask);` - The new task object is added to the `taskList` array using the `push` method.

> 8. `displayTasks(taskList);` - The `displayTasks` function is called to handle the display of tasks, passing the `taskList` array as an argument.

> 9. `taskInput.value = '';` - The task input field is cleared by setting its value to an empty string.

> 10. `function displayTasks(tasks) {` - The `displayTasks` function is defined, which takes an array of tasks as a parameter.

> 11. `let taskListElement = document.getElementById('taskList');` - The code selects the element with the id "taskList" and assigns it to the `taskListElement` variable. This element is where the task list will be displayed.

> 12. `taskListElement.innerHTML = '';` - Any existing content inside the `taskListElement` is cleared by setting its `innerHTML` property to an empty string.

> 13. `tasks.forEach(task => {` - The code iterates over each task in the `tasks` array using the `forEach` method.

> 14. `let taskElement = document.createElement('li');` - For each task, a new `li` (list item) element is created using the `createElement` method and assigned to the `taskElement` variable.

> 15. `taskElement.textContent = task.name;` - The `textContent` property of the `taskElement` is set to the name of the current task, which will be displayed as the text of the list item.

> 16. `if (task.completed) { taskElement.classList.add('completed'); }` - If the current task is marked as completed (the `completed` property is `true`), the class name "completed" is added to the `taskElement` using the `classList.add` method.

> 17. `taskListElement.appendChild(taskElement);` - The `taskElement` is appended as a child to the `taskListElement`, adding it to the displayed task list.

> 18. `displayTasks(taskList);` - The `displayTasks` function is called initially to display any existing tasks in the `taskList` array.

By following these steps, the code sets up an event listener on a form submission, adds new tasks to the `taskList` array, and displays the tasks in an HTML list.
